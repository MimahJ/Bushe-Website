        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            
            Welcome to my world! I’m **Brian "Bushe" Mutua**, a rugby player who thrives on passion, grit, and the love for the game. Right now, I'm giving my all for **Kabras RFC**, but my journey in rugby has been anything but ordinary. I started my career with **Mean Machine**, where I first learned the art of the game. From there, I had the honor of receiving **call-ups to the Shujaa squad**, and I've been chasing greatness ever since.  
            
            I've been fortunate enough to play in some of the biggest tournaments, including the Safari 7s, HSBC 7s, Kenya Cup, Mauritius 7s, and many more. Each match is a new challenge, and with every game, I push my limits—testing my speed, strength, and mind. Rugby is more than just a sport for me; it’s my life, and it drives me to constantly evolve and give everything I’ve got.  
            
            But off the field, I’m not just the guy with the ball in hand. "Bushe", as my friends call me, is known for being sociable and easy-going, always bringing energy to every gathering. And while my game may be fierce, my **kitchen skills** are just as sharp! Nothing beats a good meal shared with friends, and I take pride in being the guy who’s as comfortable in the kitchen as I am on the pitch.  
            
            I live by one simple belief:  
              "Life is too short to wallow in things you have no control over."  
            
            On and off the field, I’m all about embracing the moment, learning, and growing.</p>
